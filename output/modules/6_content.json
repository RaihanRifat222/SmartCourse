        "title": "Understanding Question Words",
        "conceptual_explanation": "Question words are essential in any language as they help us gather information. In Spanish, these words include 'qu\u00e9' (what), 'qui\u00e9n' (who), 'd\u00f3nde' (where), 'cu\u00e1ndo' (when), 'por qu\u00e9' (why), and 'c\u00f3mo' (how). They exist because they allow us to ask for specific details rather than making statements. Think of question words as keys that unlock the information you need. For example, if you want to know about someone's favorite food, you would use 'qu\u00e9' to ask, '\u00bfQu\u00e9 te gusta comer?' (What do you like to eat?). This connects to what you already know in English, where we also use question words to seek information. Understanding these words is the first step in formulating questions in Spanish.",
        "applied_explanation": "To use question words in practice, start by identifying the information you want to know. For instance, if you want to ask someone where they live, you would use 'd\u00f3nde'. The structure of your question will typically follow the format: question word + verb + subject. So, '\u00bfD\u00f3nde vives?' translates to 'Where do you live?'. Pay attention to the verb conjugation that matches the subject. A common beginner mistake is forgetting to conjugate the verb correctly, which can lead to confusion. Always ensure that your question is clear and that the verb agrees with the subject you are asking about.",
        "example": "Let's say you want to ask someone about their favorite color. You would start with the question word 'qu\u00e9'. The full question would be '\u00bfQu\u00e9 color te gusta?' which means 'What color do you like?'. Here\u2019s the breakdown: '\u00bfQu\u00e9' is the question word, 'color' is the subject, 'te' is the indirect object pronoun meaning 'to you', and 'gusta' is the verb that agrees with the singular noun 'color'. This structure is crucial as it helps you form clear and correct questions in Spanish.",

            "correct_answer": "qui\u00e9n",
            "explanation": "'Qui\u00e9n' means 'who' in Spanish, making it a question word. 'Casa' means 'house' and 'comer' means 'to eat', neither of which are question words."

        "title": "Formulating Questions in Spanish",
        "conceptual_explanation": "Formulating questions in Spanish involves understanding the structure of a question. Unlike English, where the word order can change, Spanish questions often maintain a similar structure to statements but with a few key changes. Questions exist to facilitate communication and gather information. Think of it as a conversation starter. For example, if you want to ask someone what they are doing, you would say, '\u00bfQu\u00e9 est\u00e1s haciendo?' (What are you doing?). This structure connects to your previous knowledge of English questions, where you also rearrange words to form a question.",
        "applied_explanation": "To formulate a question, start with a question word if applicable, followed by the verb and then the subject. For example, '\u00bfQu\u00e9 comes?' (What do you eat?). Here, 'comes' is the verb for 'you eat', and it is conjugated to match the subject 't\u00fa' (you). Pay attention to the verb conjugation, as this is a common area where beginners make mistakes. They might forget to change the verb form according to the subject, leading to incorrect questions. Always double-check your verb forms to ensure clarity.",
        "example": "Consider you want to ask someone when they are going to the store. You would say, '\u00bfCu\u00e1ndo vas a la tienda?' which translates to 'When are you going to the store?'. Breaking it down: '\u00bfCu\u00e1ndo' is the question word for 'when', 'vas' is the conjugated form of 'ir' (to go) for 'you', and 'a la tienda' means 'to the store'. This structure is important as it helps you create meaningful questions that others can easily understand.",

            ],
            "correct_answer": "\u00bfQu\u00e9 quieres?",
            "explanation": "'\u00bfQu\u00e9 quieres?' is the correct structure for asking 'What do you want?' in Spanish. The other options do not follow the proper question format."
