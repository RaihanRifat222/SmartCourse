        "conceptual_explanation": "React Router is a library that enables navigation among different components in a React application. It exists to help developers create single-page applications (SPAs) that can change views without reloading the entire page. Think of it like a GPS for your app; just as a GPS helps you navigate from one location to another without leaving the car, React Router allows users to move between different parts of your app seamlessly. You may already be familiar with how web pages work, where each page is a separate HTML file. React Router changes this by allowing you to define routes in your app, which are like paths that lead to different components. This is essential for creating a smooth user experience, as it keeps the app responsive and fast.",
        "applied_explanation": "To implement routing in a React app using React Router, you first need to install the library. This is done using npm, the package manager for JavaScript. Once installed, you can import the necessary components from React Router, such as BrowserRouter, Route, and Switch. The BrowserRouter component wraps your entire application, enabling routing capabilities. Inside this component, you define routes using the Route component, which specifies a path and the component to render when that path is accessed. Pay attention to the order of your routes, as React Router matches them from top to bottom. A common mistake beginners make is not wrapping their routes in BrowserRouter, which leads to routing not functioning correctly.",
        "example": "Let's say you want to create a simple React app with two pages: Home and About. First, you would install React Router by running 'npm install react-router-dom' in your terminal. Then, in your main App.js file, you would import BrowserRouter, Route, and Switch from 'react-router-dom'. You would wrap your routes in BrowserRouter like this: <BrowserRouter>. Inside it, you would use <Switch> to group your routes. For the Home page, you would write <Route path='/' exact component={Home} /> and for the About page, <Route path='/about' component={About} />. The 'exact' keyword ensures that the Home component only renders when the path is exactly '/'. This setup allows users to navigate between the Home and About pages without reloading the app.",
